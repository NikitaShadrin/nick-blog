Version 0.8 or something

What to do:

Change this readme to talk about the project

Change posts to be a timeline, make an "archive" tab with post titles and dates

Add loading cards/animations/whatever

Add likes/comments? (not sure if i actually wanna do this cause the roi is terrible BUT it might be a quality learning experience)
